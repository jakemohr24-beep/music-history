# West End Blues
“West End Blues” was originally a Southern blues piece by Joe “King” Oliver that wasn’t very popular until trumpeter Louis Armstrong from New Orleans, Louisiana, transformed it into an extraordinary song that hit and was popular back in 1928, which he recorded in Chicago back in the late 1920s. It is known as the song that changed jazz music forever.

In the late 1920s, jazz was the musical landscape starting in the cultural melting pot in New Orleans, Louisiana where people from different cultures and countries got together and created this genre. It was just the start of the growth of jazz music when ‘West End Blues” played a major role in the evolution of jazz music. Louis Armstrong changed jazz music by introducing a new level of technical skill and emotional depth to the trumpet, he was a unique talent during that time.

Other songs from this time were known to be upbeat, dance-oriented, and focus on group play. “West End Blues” was different from most songs because it was slow, emotional, and focused on Armstrong’s individual brilliance on the trumpet and this is what got most people’s attention and became one of the most popular songs at the time. Armstrong was trying to use this song for personal expression and musical storytelling.

## Musical Trends and Background Story
This song followed many traditions, but it mainly followed Southern blues traditions. The 12-bar blues form was very popular in early jazz; this was the trend that Joe “King” Oliver and Armstrong were following which was one of the most prominent chord progressions in popular music. A tradition that they did not follow was the upbeat and danceable rhythm, as mentioned earlier this song was slow tempo and emotional trying to tell a story.
 


# Creation of “West End Blues"

## Early Recordings

Composed by Joe “King” Oliver, the original rendition of “West End Blues”  is purely instrumental, with lyrics added by Clarence Williams later on. The song was first performed and recorded by King Oliver and His Dixie Syncopaters on June 11, 1928, with Brunswick Records. This first recording is a more well-rounded sound, which was typical of most band music at this time, with each instrument balanced among the others. The most well-known and popular version of this song was recorded seventeen days later by Louis Armstrong and His Hot Five on June 28th, 1928, with OKeh Records. In this version of the song, not only were Louis Armstrong’s famed trumpeting skills added, but also the song’s iconic scat singing, a gentle melodic vocalization sung by Armstrong.

Scat is a type of singing that became an integral part of Jazz, in which a vocalist sings without words. Using their voice as an instrument, the vocalist evokes emotion through the sound of their singing rather than the words. What also set this recording of the song apart was the focus on Armstrong’s instrumental playing. Compared to other recordings at the time, Louis Armstrong was the focal point of the piece.  
Two months later, the lyrics created by Clarence Williams were added to the song in his and Ethel Waters’ version, recorded on August 23, 1928, with Columbia Records. This version of the song differed significantly from the previous two recordings, with the addition of lyrics and the fact that Clarence Williams was the only instrumental accompaniment to Ethel Waters' vocals, removing the song's iconic trumpet and all other instruments. About a week later, on August 29 of that same year, Clarence went to re-record the song at OKeh Records. This time with Hazel Smith as vocalist, himself on the piano, and Joe King Oliver on the trumpet.

The song continued to rapidly have new versions being made and recorded for the next year, with the recording pace eventually ebbing out. Louis Armstrong, Joe “King” Oliver, and Clarence Williams all re-recorded another version of the song in 1929, with many other renditions of the song created that year.



## Louis Armstrong and King Oliver
Like most jazz musicians of the era, Louis Armstrong started his musical career in New Orleans, the city where he was born. He learned to play the cornet in New Orleans, while at the Colored Waifs Home, a reform school for boys of color. After leaving the school, as a teen, he started playing with local New Orleans bands, where he became an apprentice to Joe “King” Oliver. Joe “King” Oliver was dubbed “King” in New Orleans for his superb cornet skills. Oliver took the title of “King” to Chicago in the 1910s, later calling the young Louis Armstrong to join his band in Chicago in 1922.	 Louis Armstrong played with King Oliver in King Oliver’s Creole Jazz Band for two years, moving to New York in 1924 to play in Fletcher Henderson’s Band.

While in New York, he met Clarence Williams, making a series of recordings with Clarence Williams’ Blue Five. Moving back to Chicago in 1925, where he stayed until 1929, Armstrong’s fame grew. King Oliver on the other hand, moved to New York in 1927, hoping to bring the success he enjoyed in Chicago with him. This was the beginning of the end for King Oliver, as his new music made in New York did not gain the popularity he was hoping for, and his mounting health problems eventually made it impossible to play by 1930. Armstrong moved back to New York in 1929, where he was launched into the spotlight, becoming popular music and a household name heard all over the world.


## Where It Was Played and Who Listened

While the most iconic recording was made in a Chicago studio by Armstrong’s Hot Five, live performances likely occurred in African-American entertainment districts on the South Side of Chicago and in northern cities that had large Black populations due to the Great Migration (Anderson 2013). 

Audiences at these venues were predominantly African-American, though jazz was also gaining popularity among white listeners in urban nightlife settings.
The circulation of 78 rpm records allowed the music to reach audiences beyond the immediate live venues, making it accessible to listeners who could not attend clubs or dance halls (Harker 2011).


## Lyrics, Musical Voice, and Cultural Expression
Although Armstrong’s 1928 recording is largely instrumental, Oliver’s original composition had lyrics added by Clarence Williams, evoking the “West End” resort area of Lake Pontchartrain in New Orleans (Johns Hopkins Sheridan Libraries 1928).

These lyrics and Armstrong’s trumpet cadenza convey longing, personal expression, and a connection to the African-American cultural memory of New Orleans. The piece speaks to African-American musicians asserting their artistry and to listeners seeking cultural affirmation, artistic innovation, and emotional resonance.


## The Social, Political, and Economic Climate
The late 1920s were part of the “Jazz Age,” marked by booming industrial growth, urbanization, and consumer culture—but also by persistent racial segregation and economic inequality for African-Americans (Jazz, Blues, and Ragtime in America 2022).

The Great Migration brought many Black southerners to northern cities like Chicago, creating concentrated communities where jazz clubs and music venues could thrive. West End Blues emerges against this backdrop of opportunity and constraint, reflecting both the commercial potential of jazz and the social challenges faced by Black musicians and audiences (Harker 2011).
