## Lyrics

“[Verse 1]
T for Texas, T for Tennessee
T for Texas, T for Tennessee
T for Thelma, that gal that made a wreck out of me

[Refrain]
Oh-del-lay-ee oh, lay-ee eh, lay-ee


[Verse 2]
If you don't want me mama, you sure don't have to stall, oh Lord
If you don't want me mama, you sure don't have to stall
'Cause I can get more women than a passenger train can haul


[Refrain]
Oh-del-lay-ee oh, lay-ee eh, lay-ee

[Verse 3]
I'm gonna buy me a pistol just as long as I'm tall, Lord Lord
I'm gonna buy me a pistol just as long as I'm tall
I'm gonna shoot poor Thelma just to see her jump and fall


[Refrain]
Oh-del-lay-ee eh, lay-ee oh, lay-ee

[Verse 4]
I'm goin' where the water drinks like cherry wine, sing 'em boy sing 'em
Lord I'm goin' where the water drinks like cherry wine
'Cause this Georgia water tastes like turpentine

[Refrain]
Oh-del-lay-ee eh, lay-ee oh, lay-ee

[Verse 5]
I'm gonna buy me a shotgun with a great long shiny barrel
Gonna buy me a shotgun with a great long shiny barrel
I'm gonna shoot that rounder that stole away my gal


[Refrain]
Oh-del-lay-ee eh, lay-ee oh, lay-ee

[Verse 6]
Rather drink muddy water sleep in a holler log
Rather drink muddy water sleep in a holler log
Than to be in Atlanta treated like a dirty dog

[Refrain]
Oh-del-lay-ee eh, lay-ee oh, lay-ee

## About the song
The song Blue Yodel No. 1 (T for Texas) was copyrighted on February 3rd of 1928 and is part of a multi-part saga known as the Blue Yodels and was recorded during the Bristol sessions which was considered the “Big bang” of country music, about a character named Thelma, the story is told through her past lover who is the narrator and the perspective behind the lyrics,

 

Over the course of the song it is established that it takes place in Atlanta, Georgia and the narrator wants to leave and go to a different state out west like Texas or up north to Tennessee as mentioned in the text the narrator is very angry at the two other characters in the song Thelma as previously stated is a past romantic interest of the narrator and the third character is the person who Thelma was currently in a romantic relationship with, from the lyrics we can infer that the narrator plans to purchase a long barreled firearm and murder the man that Thelma is dating and maim and or possibly murder Thelma herself, then escape off to a d the lyrics are unclear if Thelma is cheating or has just moved on to someone new so that could be a reason that the narrator's mother seems to be ready to renounce him along with the rest of Georgia. 

The words in this song that during the time period would make sense are harder to understand today which decreases the punch of the double entendre that is used throughout the song

 

Turpentine is a blend of pine resin and oils that is very very flammable and is toxic if swallowed and if swallowed can be fatal.

 

“water drinks like cherry wine” is specifically used as a comparison metaphorically to turpentine and these phrases together are meant to compare locations and declare one better than the other.




“I'm gonna buy me a pistol just as long as I'm tall” is a way to express his bravado and is an over exaggeration to show that the narrator is not thinking clearly which is supported by deciding to escape to two different states in different directions.




“Rather drink muddy water sleep in a holler log” shows he does not have a plan to get to a different state and is currently in a fit of rage and is unlikely to have any survival skills whatsoever.

producer of the song is Ralph Peer
During the refrain sections of the song there is yodeling that is the reason the name of the album is “Blue Yodel” was Rodgers unique style of yodeling and popularized American yodeling the way he yodeled was unique at the time and easy to replicate and follow along and became widespread.


## Jimmie Rodgers
 "Who is Jimme Rodgers"

 James Charles Rodgers, or also known as Jimmie Rodgers was a famous country and blues singer, as well as being the popular singer of the song T for Texas. He was born in 1897 in Meridian, Mississippi, he stayed there up until the death of his mother four years later. Jimmie Rodger's Father was left alone with a child as he worked as a foreman, because of his father's work, Jimmie Rodgers got exposed to the very thing that would make him famous!

   You see, 10 years after his mother's dead, Jimmie dropped school and instead worked with his father in the rail roads. His job was to carry water for the African American workers, while he would work, "They taught him the guitar and the banjo. They taught him work songs, field hollers, chants" (Blue Yodeler: Jimmie Rodgers, Bland Simpson, Volume 12, 2006)

   When Jimmie returned to Meridian, he met a woman!

A few years later, he and his wife had two young girls, Carrie Anita and June. Unfortunately, In December of 1923, June had died from, money was tight, he had a failed project, a failed marriage and a funeral to plan, with very little choice, Jimmie Rodgers was forced to go back to the railroads as a worker. While hard at work, Jimmie ended up in Colorado and Utah, where he seemed to not be able to catch a break, for you see, he ended up catching Tuberculous...the doctor said that he will need to quit his railroad work for good.  

   Once he recovered, Jimmie and his sister-in-law would do public performances to try and gather some cash, however, this life bored him. Instead, he set off on his own, creating his own kind of yodel, the blue yodel. After this, Jimmie rogers' popularity skyrocketed! Even during the Stock Market crash in 1929, people couldn't get enough of him! 

In 1931, there was a drought that affected him greatly. It started with a few coughs but eventually turned violent fits of Tuberculosis. His song releases dropped, as well as his health. Eventually he died in 1933.

## Romance
Is Thelma representing something real that happened to Jimmie Rodgers or is she more
of a metaphorical character?
In the song T for Texas, though it is a relatively short song there is a lot to unpack about
it. Being able to distinguish the real vs metaphorical meaning of aspects within the song also are
key to analyzing this piece. Jimmie Rodgers often got regarded as the “Father of Country Music”
because of Blue Yodels #1 which T for Texas appeared on. Now the song's narrative mainly
covers the relationship between a vengeful husband and a cheating wife, with the husband
seeking to get rid of the guy her wife cheated on him with. The husband in the narrative also
brags about how “Cause I can get more women than a passenger train can haul.” (Wynne
2014). Digging deeper we can see a meaning that is not easily accessible but as a catalyst of
the genre Jimmie Rodgers also wanted to try something different to stand out by connecting
country music to blues and doing so by incorporating aspects from both genres and mixing it
into one (Wynne 2014). Thelma could be a way of lyricizing this in the song, by having her
represent the creativity that lies within making music and the guy she cheated on her husband
with the prejudice that lies between country music and blues’ inability to mix previously. For
example in the fourth stanza it states “I'm gonna shoot that rounder that stole away my gal”
(Rodgers 1927) this could be mentioning how racial prejudice towards genres of music may be
harming the genre negatively. Jimmie Rodgers innovated the genre of country and blues by
emphasizing meaning within his songs.



## How the world Responded
   "How did the world react to Jimmie Rodgers songs"

 

   "Mrs. Jimmie Rodgers, widow of the singer brakeman who became a national phenomenon and who died here last year..." writes The San Antonio Light Newspaper on October 22, in 1934. "His health broke down completely and he had to quit. All agreed that it was pretty tough for Jimmie...a lot of friends but no job and not enough strength to get and keep one. But Jimmie still wore the same old smile." was said in 1934, October 22nd by others at Steward daily getaway newspaper. 

   When the world heard the name, Jimmie Rodger's, they thought of resilience, they thought of joy through and through. They thought of the strong hearted man who wrote songs about love and loss. On October 20th, 1957, Jimmie Rodger's song "Honeycomb" was ranked 4th most popular disk jockey in Washington D.C (Evening Star, 1957, Image 107), mind you, this was 24 years after his death. His hits were so popular, that even today, you can find songs of his on Spotify, his listener's count being over 55 thousand people monthly. 
   

{% include figure.html class="right" width="60%" caption="Jimmie Rodgers on Spotify. [Source](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0Y0ZlznP6vzTS1qAm5dvTN)" image-path="images/mvh-floorplan.jpg" %}

   Looking at Spotify still, we can see that out of all of Jimmie Rodgers albums, Honeycomb is not second, the first spot being taken over by Kisses Sweet than Wine, written by Campbell and Ray Gilbert! Although he isn't a top hit today, the fact that his songs are still relevant to this day is absolutely stunning! 

   Although not directly Jimme Rodgers, the Bristol Sessions, which Jimmie was a part of, is facing some backlash. "...Sustained focus on the 1927 Bristol sessions..." which had appeared to "...neglect of other early “hillbilly” music stories" according to Ted Olson of the National Recording Registry in 2002! The Bristol sessions were a series of recordings done in 1927.

    
   Still, Rodgers has been a called a national phenomenon and considered still, one of the founder fathers, if not,                                                                                                 THE father of country music.
